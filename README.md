# Thales - code for simplifying maths operations in multiple bases

Developed for my own use to simplify common CUDA programming operations
on integers in various bases.

This simple tool is meant to be self-contained, with a relatively
up-to-date g++ compiler (definitely supporting C++11 and C++14) and
nothing else. That is why certain things have been written from a
scratch (e.g the command line argument handling), instead of using
external libraries, like Boost.
